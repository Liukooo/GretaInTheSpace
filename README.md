During our experiment, we wanted to see whether we could individuate plastic
islands in the oceans.When plastic enters the oceans, more than half is less dense than water, so it doesn’t ​sink. Plastic is very resistant and it can be transported over extended
distances by converging currents and finally accumulating in “islands” ​(1)​.

Those islands are very big, one of them, ​The Great Pacific Garbage Patch,
situated in the Pacific ocean, covers an estimated area of 1.6 million square
kilometres, an area three times the size of France ​(1)​. Despite this, such islands
are really difficult to locate from the space, because plastics are very small and
scattered.

By researching information in internet, we have individuated a range of
co​ordinates where those islands approximately are ​(3)​. Unfortunately, they are
not stationary, and move across the oceans changing form and size due to
currents and winds.

To individuate plastic, the NDVI index can be useful to calculate the quantity of
infrared rays that is reflected in a single pixel of the photo. This index is specific
for detecting healthy vegetation, but it was also used to individuate plastic in
coastal water by Biermann et al. ​(2)
